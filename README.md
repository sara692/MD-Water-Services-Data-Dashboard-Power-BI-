# 📄 README: MD Water Services Data Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of water services projects, tracking the status of water sources, improvement needs, costs, and project implementation across provinces. It is designed in two pages for seamless exploration.

🟦 Page 1 & 2 & 3 Combined Insights
🔷 KPIs (Across Both Pages)
Total water sources – Number of surveyed water sources.

Number of sources needing repair – Highlights infrastructure gaps.

Number of improved sources – Shows progress in water source upgrades.

Total project cost – Sum of expenditures on all water-related projects.

Total project count – Number of distinct projects executed.

Number of towns served – Reach of interventions.

🔷 Key Visuals
✅ Distribution of Water Source Status by Type (Page 1)

Chart type: Stacked bar chart

Y-axis: Water source type

X-axis: Number of sources

Legend: Source status (e.g., needs repair, functioning)

Purpose: Identify which types of water sources require the most attention.

✅ Map of Water Sources (Page 1)

Displays: Locations of sources with status indications.

Purpose: Visualize the geographical spread of water issues or improvements.

✅ Distribution of Water Source Types Across Provinces (Page 2)

Chart type: Horizontal stacked bar chart

Y-axis: Province names

X-axis: Sum of costs

Legend: Improvement types (e.g., drill well, install taps)

Purpose: See how funding is allocated across provinces and intervention types.

✅ Project Implementation Trends by Year and Province (Page 2)

Chart type: Line chart

X-axis: Year

Y-axis: Count of projects

Legend: Province

Purpose: Track project activity over time across different provinces.

🔎 Filters Available (Across Both Pages)

Province name

💡 How to Use This Dashboard
Use filters to narrow analysis to specific water source types, improvement actions, towns, or provinces.

On Page 1, focus on understanding which water sources are in need of repair and where they are located.

On Page 2, analyze how financial resources are distributed, what improvements are being implemented, and track yearly project trends across provinces.

Click on elements in visuals (bars, legends, lines) to cross-filter other charts on the same page for interactive exploration.

Compare the project cost distribution with project count trends to identify regions that may need more investment or have successful implementation rates.

📝 Notes
Each page provides unique insights, but together they give a complete picture of both water source conditions and project performance.

Filters on each page operate independently.

Ensure data is refreshed regularly to reflect the latest field updates.
